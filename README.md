# house-price-prediction
A Machine Learning web application that predicts house prices based on user input features.  
Built using **Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit**.
# Project Overview
The House Price Prediction Web App is a machine learning–based application that estimates the price of a house based on key input features such as area, number of rooms, and other property characteristics.
The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment through an interactive web interface. The predictive model was built using Python and Scikit-learn, then integrated into a simple web application using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
This project showcases practical skills in data analysis, regression modeling, model serialization, and building user-friendly ML applications suitable for portfolio demonstration.
